# Pacemaker-HeartSimulator
The programme is written in the programming language Java. The programme simulates a heart's pulse. There are three different situations. The pulse is between acceptable ranges, the pulse is greater than expected or smaller than expected. The pacemaker takes necessary actions to correct the pulse.

This project was the result of team work with 2 other students. An academic security report was created explaining possible attacks and countermeasures for a pacemaker.
