# Pacemaker-HeartSimulator
The programme is written in the programming language Java. The programme simulates a heart's pulse. There are three different situations. The pulse is between acceptable ranges, the pulse is greater than expected or smaller than expected. The pacemaker takes necessary actions to correct the pulse.
